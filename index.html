<p>Podcast transcripts are nice and all, but difficult to find and organize. Pod2Book gives you a proper eBook with chapters, covers, and all the features you expect—perfect for your library.</p>

<h2>About Pod2Book</h2>
</header>
<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p>The idea for transcribing podcasts to eBooks came about whilst listening to a podcast that was very scientific, with a lot of information & details. I wanted to capture what the person was saying and be able to go back and review, highlight, create notes, study, etc. Then came different podcasts I wanted to do the same thing with.</p>
<p>I then thought to myself, "Self, this could also be valuable for people that are neurodivergent, or just like to read." I also shared the idea with someone else, and they were like, "Oh yeah that would help people that are deaf or hard of hearing too." I wish I thought of that part myself.</p>
<p>Podcast transcripts are nice and all, but difficult to find and organize. What I would really like is to have a storefront/library that has all these podcasts-turned-eBooks organized by author that could then be subscribed to on your eBook reader of choice.</p>
<p>Well, since I don't own the copyright to any of these, I figured—why not make it easy for everyone to create their own libraries? You can use <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a> to organize your collection.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Thanks,<br />
